### Description
Trained a neural model to identify and classify simple fruits in the immediate environment. 90% training performance and 84.62% real-world success rate. This was a class Project.

### Task
> "Create a model that identifies and correctly classifies objects, and in real time. For this course we'll be grouping you all in groups of tens <br/>...We'll be using Edge Impulse for this project as well."<br/> &#8211; Dr. Segun Adebayo

My group was tasked with sorting oranges and cherries.

### Steps
* Gathered as a group
* Assigned individual tasks
* Bought a lot of oranges and cherries
* Started training the neural model


### Challenges Faced
* Off season for oranges
>By the way, are oranges called oranges because oranges are orange?üëÄ
* Variable lighting conditions in training image data
* Classification problems for similar looking fruits

### Results
* Last training performance (validation set) F1 SCORE = 90.0%
* Model testing results: ACCURACY = 84.62%
* Lots of oranges and cherries to go around for group members üòÅ
