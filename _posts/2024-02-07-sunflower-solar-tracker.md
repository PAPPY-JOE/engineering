### Description
I captained a team of four Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate colleagues to build a single-axis solar tracker system that maximizes solar energy generation, leveraging Arduino and accessible electronic components. This was a class project.

### Skills 
* C++ using Arduino IDE
* 3D modelling using Solid Works
* 3D model slicing and optimisation using UltiMaker Cura
* 3D printing using Creality Ender-3 3D printer

### Task
> "Come up with multiple mini project ideas, from which you will be assigned only one, the best, to build. For this course we'll be grouping you all in groups of fives <br/>...There are no restrictions to your imagination, only cost and time feasibility." <br/>&#8211; Dr. Segun Adebayo

My group agreed on and was tasked with building a sunflower solar tracker, courtsey of Awani Toritseju.

### Steps
* Gathered as a group
* Assigned individual tasks
* Ran simulations of the project
* Purchased needed electronics components
* Started building the first prototype with a carton frame
* Started building the second and final prototype with a 3D printed frame

### Challenges Faced
* Hardware issues with Arduino Nano
* Prolonged duration for 3D printed final case
* Assembly
* Financial constraints
* Availability of electronics components
