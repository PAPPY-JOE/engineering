### Description
Captained a team of four Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate colleagues to build a single-axis solar tracker system to maximize solar energy generation, leveraging Arduino and accessible electronic components. This was a class project.

### Skills 
* C++ using Arduino IDE
* 3D modelling using Solid Works
* 3D model slicing and optimisation using UltiMaker Cura
* 3D printing using Creality Ender-3 3D printer

### Task
> "Come up with multiple mini project ideas, from which you will be assigned only one to build. For this course we'll be grouping you all in groups of fives <br/>...There are no restrictions to your imagination, only cost and time feasibility." &#8211; Dr. Segun Adebayo

My group agreed on and was tasked with building a sunflower solar tracker, courtsey of Awani Toritseju.

### Steps
* Gathered as a group
* Assigned individual tasks
* Ran simulations of the project
* Purchased needed electronics components
* Started building the first prototype with a carton frame
* Started building the second and final prototype with a 3D printed frame

### Challenges Faced
* Hardware issues with Arduino Nano
* Prolonged duration for 3D printed final case
* Assembly
* Financial constraints

### Results
* Successful single-axis solar tracker
* Up to 25% increase in solar energy generation
