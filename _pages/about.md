As an aspiring Mechatronics engineering professional, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of the field of robotics engineering. I take pride in being one of the very best in a highly competitive class environment, and I am committed to advancing robotics engineering in my native country of Nigeria.

My research interests include Cognitive Robotics, Automation, Soft Robots, Robot Modelling and Simulation, and Internet of Things. I have developed excellent technical and communication skills, including experience in Solid Works, AutoCAD, Mathlab, Edge Impulse, and currently learning python.

I have overcome challenges in my academic journey, and these experiences have taught me to persevere in the face of obstacles. I am inspired by fellow Nigerian Silas Adekunle, the highest-paid robotics engineer in the world, as well as my college professors, including Professor Christian O. Osueke and Dr. Segun Adebayo.

With a dedication to lifelong learning and a passion for robotics engineering, I am excited to contribute to the field of Mechatronics engineering and work towards creating positive change in the industry
