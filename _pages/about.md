Hi there! I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Mechatronics Engineering at Bowen University with a keen interest in developing Intelligent Robotic models.

> Humans aren’t intelligent because they can play chess, but because they can learn anything. <br/> Now replace “Humans” with “AI systems”

Recently, I was selected as an **AAAI-24 UC Scholar**. The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, which was held in Vancouver, Canada (Feb. 2024), afforded me the opportunity to meet with top researchers and industry giants, as well as talented peers from around the world. This has broadened my perspective and increased my knowledge and passion for the field.

I am inspired by Turing Award winning French-American computer scientist Yann LeCun, American roboticist Leslie Kaelbling and fellow Nigerian Silas Adekunle, the highest-paid robotics engineer in the world, as well as my college professors, including Professor Christian O. Osueke and Dr. Segun Adebayo.

With a dedication to lifelong learning and a passion for Robotics, I am excited to contribute to the field of Mechatronics engineering and work towards creating positive change in the industry.
