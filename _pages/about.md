Hi there! I am an fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Mechatronics Engineering at Bowen University with a keen interest in developing Intelligent Robotic models.

Recently, I was selected as an **AAAI-24 UC Scholar**.

I have overcome challenges in my academic journey, and these experiences have taught me to persevere in the face of obstacles. I am inspired by fellow Nigerian Silas Adekunle, the highest-paid robotics engineer in the world, as well as my college professors, including Professor Christian O. Osueke and Dr. Segun Adebayo.

With a dedication to lifelong learning and a passion for Robotics, I am excited to contribute to the field of Mechatronics engineering and work towards creating positive change in the industry.
